## Technical Simulation Report

### Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive simulation study demonstrating adaptive peer clustering mechanisms combined with Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) in decentralized peer-to-peer networks. Our simulation framework evaluates how performance-based clustering improves message propagation resilience and efficiency compared to baseline random peer selection approaches.

**Key Findings:**
- Adaptive clustering provides 0.78% improvement in packet delivery reliability (EWMA PDR)
- Redundancy overhead reduced by 1.36% through intelligent peer selection
- Network demonstrates robust behavior under 40% node churn
- Clustering effectively groups peers by bandwidth, latency, and reliability characteristics

### 1. Introduction and Objectives

The proliferation of decentralized systems and peer-to-peer networks has created a critical need for robust, efficient data dissemination protocols. Traditional gossip protocols face challenges in dynamic environments with variable link quality, node churn, and bandwidth constraints. Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) has emerged as a promising approach for improving network coding efficiency, while adaptive clustering can optimize peer selection based on performance metrics.

**Research Objectives:**
1. Implement a working RLNC-based P2P network simulation
2. Design and evaluate adaptive peer clustering algorithms based on link quality metrics
3. Compare performance against baseline random peer selection
4. Analyze resilience under network churn and disruption scenarios
5. Demonstrate practical applicability to OptimumP2P-style architectures

### 2. Methodology and System Architecture

#### 2.1 Network Setup and Topology

Our simulation creates a dynamic mesh network with the following specifications:
- **Node Count:** 30 peers in mesh topology  
- **Connection Probability:** 0.3 (resulting in average degree 8.87)
- **Network Density:** 0.306 with average clustering coefficient 0.320
- **Link Characteristics:** Variable latency (10-100ms), bandwidth (100-1000 KB/s), packet loss (5%)

#### 2.2 RLNC Implementation

The Random Linear Network Coding layer implements key RLNC principles:

**Encoding Process:**
- Messages divided into generations of 32 packets
- Random coefficients selected from finite field GF(2^8)
- Linear combinations created using: `y = Σ(αᵢ × xᵢ)` where αᵢ are random coefficients
- Gaussian elimination used for decoding at receivers

**Packet Structure:**
- Generation ID for packet grouping
- Coefficient vector for decoding
- Encoded payload data
- Timestamp and source metadata

#### 2.3 Adaptive Clustering Logic

The clustering manager implements performance-based peer grouping:

**Metrics Calculation:**
- **Bandwidth Score:** Normalized upload capacity (0-1)
- **Reliability Score:** EWMA packet delivery rate
- **Latency Score:** Inverse of round-trip time
- **Uptime Score:** Node availability history

**Peer Scoring Formula:**
```
Total Score = 0.3×Bandwidth + 0.4×Reliability + 0.2×(1/Latency) + 0.1×Uptime
```

**Clustering Algorithm:**
- K-means clustering applied to 4-dimensional feature space
- Dynamic cluster count (2-5 clusters based on network size)
- Re-clustering performed every 10 simulation steps
- Preferred peer selection within cluster boundaries

#### 2.4 EWMA Performance Tracking

Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) statistics track node performance:
- **Update Formula:** `EWMA_t = α×Current_PDR + (1-α)×EWMA_{t-1}`
- **Smoothing Parameter:** α = 0.3 for balanced responsiveness
- **Applications:** Reliability assessment, cluster assignment, peer ranking

### 3. Performance Evaluation Framework
