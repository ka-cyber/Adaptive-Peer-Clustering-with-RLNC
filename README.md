# Adaptive-Peer-Clustering-with-RLNC
I've successfully built a comprehensive simulation demonstrating Adaptive Peer Clustering with Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) in decentralized P2P networks. This prototype showcases how performance-based clustering improves RLNC message propagation compared to baseline approaches.
